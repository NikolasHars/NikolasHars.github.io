Hello there! I'm a Master's student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology with **strong software development background**, deeply passionate about `Computer Vision` and `Deep Learning`, specifically focused on enhancing perception and understanding for autonomous vehicles.

In my research journey, I've gained hands-on expertise in `Multiple-Object Tracking`, `Object Detection`, [Monocular Depth Estimation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.03771), and worked on innovative projects involving generalizable Signed Distance Function (SDF) networks, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), and stepped into the realm of Reinforcement Learning (RL). I've also explored the exciting intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) using models like [CLIP](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.02329).

Currently, I'm doing a full-time internship at [Aegis Rider](https://aegisrider.com/), where we utilize `Augmented Reality (AR)` and cutting-edge technologies to increase safety for motorcycle riders through innovative solutions.

Beyond academia and work, I find joy in cycling, bouldering, and collaborative cooking evenings with friends, where I take pleasure in exploring diverse recipes from various cultures.
